# airlineAPI

You work for an app company that focuses on cheap flights out of Portland, OR Airport (PDX).
They are putting on a marketing campaign in September and want to offer a few last min flights to travelers.
They want you to come up with the cheapest flights from PDX to (San Diego, California),
(Austin, Texas), (Orlando, Florida) and one city of your choosing.  The dates are leaving Sept 15 and returning anytime in Sept.
HINTS:  
 - You find the skyscanner API and just happen upon their docs at https://skyscanner.github.io/slate/#api-documentation
 - If you cant find the quick way to get the apiKey then maybe Jacob could help you (You get docked a pt for this)
 - Dont forget to run npm i
DATA Requirements:
- Must make all calls as fast as possible.  No 'awaiting' around on this one!
- Return cheapest flight for each destination and sort by City Name ascending
- You get to decide the construction of your return object but Tisha will be judging what makes most sense to her
